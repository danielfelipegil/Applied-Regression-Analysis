Question 5
Big p-values (p>.05) conclude which one of the following?
Your Answer		Score	Explanation
Accept the null hypothesis			
Fail to reject the null hypothesis
Correct	1.00	Good job! It is incorrect to ‘accept’ the null hypothesis. Statisticians will always use ‘fail to reject the null hypothesis’.

Question 6
What does a positive slope indicate?
Your Answer		Score	Explanation
As X increases, Y increases	
Correct	1.00	Great job! A positive slope always indicates that Y is increasing with X. If Y were to decrease with increases in X, this would indicate a negative slope.
No association between X and Y			
As X increases, Y decreases
